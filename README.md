# Roblox Trade Currency Bot #

## UPCOMING UPDATE: 3.0 ##
### This update will have a massively improved trading algorithm, better error handling, and much much more! ###
# !!WARNING!! #
** THE NEW 3.0 UPDATE *WILL* SAVE YOUR USERNAME AND PASSWORD TO FILE(ONLY TO YOUR COMPUTER. IT IS NOT BEING SAVED ANYWHERE ELSE.) IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS, CONTINUE USING 2.0**

** THIS REPLACES CURRENT BEHAVIOUR, WHERE IT DOES NOT SAVE THEM, ONLY THE .ROBLOSECURITY COOKIE WHICH IS USED TO LOAD THE ACCOUNT **

** THIS IS BEING DONE SO THAT THE BOT CAN RUN 24/7 **
** CURRENTLY, THE COOKIE CAN EXPIRE(THAT MEANS IT WONT WORK ANYMORE, AND CRASH THE BOT) AND IT WILL HAVE NO WAY TO LOGIN AGAIN, EXCEPT RESTARTING. **

** THIS WILL ALLOW THE BOT TO AUTOMATICALLY LOG IN AND RESUME TRADING IF THE COOKIE EXPIRES, MEANING IT CAN RUN 24/7 WITHOUT INTERRUPTION **
