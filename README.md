# Iaz3's Roblox Trade Currency Bot #

# ROBLOX Discontinuing Tickets. TCBot useless starting 4/13/2016 #

[ROBLOX saying goodbye to tickets](http://blog.roblox.com/2016/03/saying-goodbye-to-tickets/)

ROBLOX is removing the Trade Currency, and the Tickets. in 30 days

Starting April 13th, the TCBot will be useless.

I recommend running the bot to make whatever you can, but making sure to stop it and get all your tickets to robux before they're gone forever. **Be Warned. You could in theory lose money this way. The rates are going to go crazy as everyone trades to ROBUX. You might be at a loss by the time you cancel it.**
